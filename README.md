### Analysis
For the data points, there is an increasing relationship for the factors as each minute passes. The pi value also starts at 4 and gradually converges to the value of pi. However, there is a slight fluctuation with the value of pi and is still oscillating closer and closer to the value of pi. These patterns can be related to the calculations and iterations as each minute passes.
